UNITED NATIONS â€” The United Nations Security Council on Monday ratcheted up sanctions yet
again against North Korea, but they fell significantly short of the far-reaching penalties
that the Trump administration had demanded just days ago.

While the sanctions were described in Washington and other capitals as the most extensive yet,
in the end they amounted to another incremental increase of pressure on the country, even after
it detonated its sixth and most powerful nuclear device.

It was far from clear that the additional penalties would accomplish what the Trump administration
said was its goal: To force North Korea to halt its nuclear and ballistic missile tests and reopen
some kind of negotiation toward eventual nuclear disarmament.
